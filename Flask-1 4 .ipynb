    "Advantages of Flask Framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplicity: Flask is straightforward and easy to get started with. Its simplicity makes it a great choice for beginners and for rapidly prototyping web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lightweight: As a micro-framework, Flask is minimalist and doesn't come bundled with unnecessary features. It allows developers to add the components they need, offering more flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: Flask is scalable, enabling developers to scale their applications as they grow without complicating the existing structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extensible: It provides the flexibility to add libraries and extensions as required, allowing developers to use third-party libraries to extend functionality easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jinja2 Templating: Flask uses Jinja2, a powerful and designer-friendly templating engine that enables template inheritance, creating layouts, and avoiding code duplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Built-in Development Server: Flask comes with a built-in development server, enabling developers to test applications locally without requiring additional setups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extensive Documentation: Flask has comprehensive and well-organized documentation, making it easier for developers to understand and use the framework effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Community and Ecosystem: Flask has a strong and active community, providing numerous extensions and resources, which can help in quickly solving issues and finding solutions.\n",
